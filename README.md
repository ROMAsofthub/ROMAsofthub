## About [ROMA]software
Hello! I am the creator and sole developer behind **[ROMA]software**. My passion for technology and programming has led me to create this personal project, where I develop small applications and tools for the general public as a hobby. Through small programs and practical solutions, I aim to contribute to the open-source software community and help others with simple yet effective projects.

Even though I am a one-person team, every line of code is written with dedication and care, always striving to deliver functional and high-quality products.

## Mission
At **[ROMA]software**, my goal is simple: to create small but powerful software solutions that are accessible, useful, and understandable. I love the idea that something as small as a script can make a big difference, which is why I focus on developing tools that simplify everyday tasks for both end users and other developers.

## Languages

At **[ROMA]software**, I use a variety of programming languages and tools to bring projects to life:

- **Python**: Versatile and simple, I use Python for automation scripts, CLI tools, bots, and small web applications.
- **SQL**: Essential for managing and querying databases efficiently.
- **Bash**: A key tool for automating tasks in Linux environments.
- **JavaScript**: Used for building interactive web applications, both frontend and backend (Node.js).
- **C#**: Ideal for developing more advanced desktop applications, especially for Windows.
