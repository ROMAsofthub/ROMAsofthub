## About [ROMA]software
Hello! I am the creator and sole developer behind **[ROMA]software**. My passion for technology and programming has led me to create this personal project, where I develop small applications and tools for the general public as a hobby. Through small programs and practical solutions, I aim to contribute to the open-source software community and help others with simple yet effective projects.

Even though I am a one-person team, every line of code is written with dedication and care, always striving to deliver functional and high-quality products!

## Mission
At **[ROMA]software**, my goal is simple: to create small but powerful software solutions that are accessible, useful, and understandable. I love the idea that something as small as a script can make a big difference, which is why I focus on developing tools that simplify everyday tasks for both end users and other developers.

## What Do We Do?
While my primary focus is on developing small and useful programs for various needs, the projects I create are quite diverse. Here at **[ROMA]software**, I develop:

- Command-line tools (CLI) that help automate repetitive tasks.
- Lightweight desktop applications for users who need a simple and functional interface.
- Small web applications that address specific needs.
- Scripts to manage databases and run optimized SQL queries.
- Automation utilities using Bash to streamline processes in Linux-based systems.

Whether it's to optimize your workflow or create something fun, I’m always open to new ideas and interesting projects.

## Languages and Technologies
The projects at **[ROMA]software** are created using a variety of programming languages and tools. Here are some of the main ones I work with:

### Python
One of my favorite languages due to its versatility and simplicity. I use Python to create automation scripts, CLI tools, bots, and small web applications. Its vast library ecosystem and support make it ideal for rapid prototyping and efficient solutions.

### SQL
The backbone of any application that needs to store and retrieve structured data. I use SQL to manage databases, write optimized queries, and generate reports that extract valuable insights from data.

### Bash
Automation is key to improving efficiency, and Bash allows me to write powerful scripts to handle repetitive tasks in Linux-based systems. Whether it's system configurations or automated workflows, Bash is an indispensable tool.

### JavaScript
JavaScript is essential when building interactive web applications. I use it for both frontend development and, in some cases, backend development (with Node.js) to create dynamic and responsive interfaces.

### C#
I use C# to develop more advanced desktop applications, especially those requiring a richer and more complete graphical interface. It’s also a great option for performance-oriented Windows applications.

## Development Philosophy
At **[ROMA]software**, I follow a set of key principles for every project I develop:

1. **Simplicity**: Simplicity is essential. I believe in writing code that is understandable and easy to maintain.
2. **Functionality**: Each project should solve a specific problem in the most efficient way possible.
3. **Open Source**: Whenever possible, projects are published under an open license, so others can learn, use, and contribute.
4. **Optimization**: I aim for my programs to be lightweight and resource-efficient, respecting the memory and processing power of the devices where they run.

## Tools and Platforms
Throughout my work at **[ROMA]software**, I use a variety of tools and platforms to develop, test, and distribute my projects:

- **GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
- **VSCode**: My main code editor, optimized with extensions for each language I use.
- **Heroku and Vercel**: For quick deployment of web applications and APIs.
- **Linux & Windows**: I develop on both Linux and Windows environments, depending on the type of project.
